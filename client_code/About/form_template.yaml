      ### Under the program commonly referred to as "Code Blue", New York State mandates
      that, whenever wind chill temperatures fall to 32 degrees Fahrenheit or lower,
      county Departments of Social Services must provide shelter from the elements
      to all persons who present as homeless -- without regard to whether those persons
      are eligible for any other benefits or services under the Federal, State, and/or
      Local programs that those departments administer.


      ### In many counties, during several months each year, wind chill temperatures
      during the daylight hours remain above the 32 degree threshold, while nighttime
      wind chill temperatures are at or below that level.  To plan for provision of
      staff and other resources necessary to provide *Code Blue* services,  local
      social services districts and their contracted homeless services providers rely
      on weather forecasts.  Often, the overnight forecast "as of" a specified time
      of day is used to determine whether or not the *Code Blue* program services
      will be provided that evening.


      # Purpose

      ### This app was created to automate the process of checking and communicating
      wind chill forecasts to *Code Blue* stakeholders.


      ### On a schedule that can be uniquely established for each location, up to
      once daily this **Wind Chill Notification Service** accesses the **[National
      Weather Service](https://forecast.weather.gov/)**''s offical forecast data and
      notifies that location''s subscribers of the results via email and/or text message.',
