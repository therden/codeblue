# Purpose

### This service was created to automate the process of checking and communicating about wind chill forecasts on a fixed schedule.

### On a schedule that can be uniquely established for each defined *location*, once each day the **Wind Chill Notification Service** accesses the **[National Weather Service](https://forecast.weather.gov/)**'s offical forecast data and notifies that location's subscribers of the results via email and/or text message.


# Background

### Under the program commonly referred to as "Code Blue", New York State mandates that, whenever wind chill temperatures fall to 32 degrees Fahrenheit or lower, the Department of Social Services in each of its counties must provide shelter from the elements to all persons who present as homeless -- without regard to whether those persons are eligible or are even willing to apply for any other benefits or services under the Federal, State, and/or Local programs that those departments administer.

### In many of those counties, during several months each year, wind chill temperatures remain above the 32 degrees threshold for much of the day, but will reach or dip below it at other times.  

### In order to arrange for staffing and other resources that are part of *Code Blue* service provision, local social services districts and their contracted homeless services providers rely on weather forecasts.  Often, the overnight forecast "as of" a specified time of day is used to determine whether or not the *Code Blue* program services will be provided that evening.

### This web service makes the acquisition and distribution of those forecasts automatic.
